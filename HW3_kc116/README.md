# Part 2

Here is a link to the ipy notebook

https://jupyterlab.cusp.adrf.cloud/user/kc116/lab/tree/PUIdata%2FHW3_KC116.ipynb

**I just realized this link won't work for you so I'm adding screenshots (9/30/18). I had to do several commits to figure this out. I will be going to the TA for further help on downloading .ipynb and uploading properly. I did this on time originally! plllllease don't take off for lateness, I didn't know it wasn't going to work**
