Worked alone on assignment 1 & 2 (attended TA hours for help)


# Assignment 1

For assignment 1, I used data found at [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam). In the my notbook, I plotted all leading causes of death per gender. My final plot represents deaths categorized as 'accidental', per gender. Note: The provided data only includes male and female identities.
