# Assignment 2 Review:
 ## 1. Hypothesis evaluation:
 Having read the Idea for analysis, it is clear to me that the author wants to 
Alternative Hypothesis: During the weekends there will be more 'Customers'(non-subscribers who purchase 24hr passes) using Citibike than regular subscribers.
Null Hypothesis: Weekend activity has the same or less users described as 'customers.'
 However, it lacks certain specifications that would make the hypothesis testable, despite giving the significance level. 

 Please note that despite the fact that all citibike data is provided, I assume we only compare two samples without population knowledge. This is assumption I decide to follow, however given we actually can calculate the population data, it could be restated accordingly.
 ## 2. Data 
 The data for two genders and durations for a specific time period has been identified. I would suggest in addition to separate the two samples into two df objects (for male and female separately) and normalizing, since we are looking at the mean. At a first glance the distribution for both genders resembles Gaussian.
